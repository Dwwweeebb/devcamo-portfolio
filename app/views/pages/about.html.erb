        <p>Darth Vader, also known by his birth name Anakin Skywalker, 
        is a fictional character in the Star Wars franchise.
          Vader appears in the original film trilogy as a pivotal antagonist whose actions drive the plot, 
          while his past as Anakin Skywalker and the story 
          of his corruption are central to the narrative of the prequel trilogy.</p>

        <p>Darth Vader has become one of the most iconic villains in popular culture, and has been listed among the 
          greatest villains and fictional characters ever.
          The American Film Institute listed him as the third greatest movie villain in cinema history on 100 Years... 
          100 Heroes and Villains, 
          behind Hannibal Lecter and Norman Bates. However, other critics consider him a tragic hero, citing his
          original motivations for the greater good before his fall to the dark side.</p>
